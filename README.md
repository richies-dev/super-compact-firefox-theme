# A Super Compact Firefox Theme

This is a Firefox theme that is inspired by Qute Browser. It is a heavily modified version of https://github.com/Dook97/firefox-qutebrowser-userchrome .

The CSS for this theme is not the best since I didn't want to invest too much time into learning Firefox's CSS ways. It is kind of a mess, but it works well for my purposes. 
I would like to improve it if I ever have the time to since I understand how they do things much better now.
