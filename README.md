# A Super Compact Firefox Theme

This is a Firefox theme that is inspired by Qute Browser. It is a heavily modified version of https://github.com/Dook97/firefox-qutebrowser-userchrome .

Currently this project is a work in progress. Most of the theme is finished and looks nice, but there are a couple of tweaks I would like to make such as restructuring the CSS (as much as I can with ff's conventions) so that it is a bit easier to read.
